# ðŸš— Dynamic Pricing for Urban Parking Lots â€“ Model 1

## Overview
This project simulates dynamic pricing for parking lots using real-time occupancy data. The goal is to balance demand and availability using a baseline linear pricing model.

## Model 1 â€“ Baseline Linear Formula

Price = Previous Price + Î± Ã— (Occupancy / Capacity)


- Î± = 5  
- Price is capped between â‚¹5 and â‚¹20  
- Simple and interpretable logic

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- Google Colab

## Output Example

Time Step 1: â‚¹13.2
Time Step 2: â‚¹15.4
Time Step 3: â‚¹17.8
